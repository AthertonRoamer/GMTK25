GMTK 25 THEME: LOOP

MAIN IDEA: 
	dude goes in high tech base and each level is a room full of security made of traps and turrets.
	each level gives the player a certain amount of loops each having a certain amount of moves.
	whenever the player dies the next loop begins, if he is saved in the future the player regains
	those lost moves.

LOOPING:
	two actions per move per loop or bullets for use at any time one move per turn
	actions:
		moving
		attacking

TRAPS/TURRETS:
	bullet: half health
	sniper: kills
	rough terrain: halves movespeed
	suppressor trap: cant shoot inside effect
	human harvester gate: requires death to open
	pit, lasers, gates
	chips and arms could act as keys for gates
